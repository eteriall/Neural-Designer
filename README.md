# Neural Designer 💻

* Neural Designer is a service that enables the creation of informal brand identity for small and medium-sized businesses. Through the platform, users can generate logos for their organizations. The generation process relies on multiple NLP functions, cascades of neural networks for concept creation and color palette selection, as well as other algorithms required for logo generation.

* The core concept of the service is ease of use. The user enters one or more keywords, after which the service creates a project containing multiple variations of logos and design concepts for the organization. These results can be used directly to build a business identity or handed over to a designer for further refinement.
